      <description>Due to the war in Ukraine I recently moved to Georgia and the first big issue I faced was Georgian alphabet. They don&amp;rsquo;t use Latin or Cyrillic charaters so I needed to learn it to be able to read and study Georgian language. To say the truth I always liked their characters - they are really nice, looke for your self: ყოველთვის მომწონდა ქართული ანბანი :) But for an unprepared person, they are almost indistinguishable from each other.</description>

      <description>I was an ordinary Facebook user, not very social one - had a handful of &amp;ldquo;friends&amp;rdquo;, almost never posted or liked anything, mostly consumed newsfeed of people and groups I was subscribed to. I had an Instagram account where shared private photos with my friends. And I used Whatsapp as my primary messenger to communicate with everyone - family, friends, colleagues and other people I know.
All was good for many years.</description>
