      <description>I was an ordinary Facebook user, not very social one - had a handful of &amp;ldquo;friends&amp;rdquo;, almost never posted or liked anything, mostly consumed news feed of people and groups I was subscribed to. I had an Instagram account where shared private photos with my friends. And I used WhatsApp as my primary messenger to communicate with everyone - family, friends, colleagues and other people I know.
All was good for many years.</description>
