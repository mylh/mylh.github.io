      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was an ordinary Facebook user, not very social one - had a handful of &amp;ldquo;friends&amp;rdquo;, almost never posted or liked anything, mostly consumed news feed of people and groups I was subscribed to. I had an Instagram account where shared private photos with my friends. And I used WhatsApp as my primary messenger to communicate with everyone - family, friends, colleagues and other people I know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All was good for many years. Until one evening I couldn&amp;rsquo;t log in to my Instagram account. It was blocked and I was requested to provide additional information including my real name and phone number to restore access to the account. I supplied all the information and went to bed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
