      <description>I can say that I&amp;rsquo;m a serial maker. From my early days on the Internet I try to create various online projects. When I do work for someone else I can&amp;rsquo;t say that every time I do the most interesting things out there, and this is where my side projects help me to keep going: I can learn whatever technology I want, I can do whatever I want in a way I want :) So it benefits a lot.</description>

      <description>For over a year I have been siletnly playing with neural networks. Artificial Intelligence is definitely the future of humanity if it survives and neural networks is the most promising piece of technology leading us there. My main area of interests besides general AI lies in joining music and AI and so I was playing with it but there are no any great results yet to share. And recently there was a really revolutionary thing happened - a group of researchers released Stable Diffusion - a neural network capable of generating images given a textual prompt.</description>

      <description>Due to the war in Ukraine I recently moved to Georgia and the first big issue I faced was Georgian alphabet. They don&amp;rsquo;t use Latin or Cyrillic characters so I needed to learn it to be able to read and study Georgian language. To say the truth I always liked their characters - they are really nice, look for your self: ყოველთვის მომწონდა ქართული ანბანი :) But for an unprepared person, they are almost indistinguishable from each other.</description>
