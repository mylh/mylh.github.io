      <description>&lt;p&gt;I can say that I&amp;rsquo;m a serial maker and entrepreneur by spirit. From my early days on the Internet I try to create various online projects and convert them into stable businesses. When I do work for someone else (freelance, contractor jobs) I can&amp;rsquo;t say that every time I do the most interesting things out there, and this is where my ventures help me to keep going: I can learn whatever technology I want, I can do whatever I want in a way I want :) So it benefits a lot. Here is an incomplete (I hope) list of my projects. If a project generated revenue I put a $ sign corresponding to each digit in the total revenue for the project. ✝ - means project is discontinued.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We&amp;rsquo;ve all been there, spending days or even weeks brainstorming names and searching for available domain names. But what if I told you that you can now generate dozens of creative names and find available domains in just minutes? Sounds too good to be true, right? Well, not anymore! Introducing the Startup Name Generator with ChatGPT and Domain Availability Checker, a utility I built to make this process easier and faster than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>IndieHacker Boilerplate (Django Template)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi fellow indiehackers. I created a template project to quickly hop into a new project journey if you build with python, django and react and want to share it with you. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mylh/indiehacker-boilerplate&#34;&gt;https://github.com/mylh/indiehacker-boilerplate&lt;/a&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s opensource and under MIT license. I hope it will save some time for you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I created many projects over the years and every time I had to repeat same boring steps before can actually start implementing a new idea. But not anymore from now. With this template you literally can start implementing your idea in minutes. Just start a new django project with django-admin startproject and after running docker-compose up you&amp;rsquo;ll have a complete website, as well as ansible deployments script to put it into production.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>DreamPic.AI - AI Generated Pictures Starring You</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For over a year I have been siletnly playing with neural networks. Artificial Intelligence is definitely the future of humanity if it survives and neural networks is the most promising piece of technology leading us there. My main area of interests besides general AI lies in joining music and AI and so I was playing with it but there are no any great results yet to share. And recently there was a really revolutionary thing happened - a &lt;a href=&#34;https://stability.ai/&#34;&gt;group of researchers&lt;/a&gt; released &lt;a href=&#34;https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release&#34;&gt;Stable Diffusion&lt;/a&gt; - a neural network capable of generating images given a textual prompt. Why it was revolutionary? Because it is going to change all graphical design industry and many more related industries and how people work. All history of human graphical art and expression is compressed into several gigabytes of neural network model that you can freely download and run on your machine to generate never exited before artworks. What people do with SD is mind blowing. And one of such things is training SD with pictures of a person so it is capable of producing new pictures of that person in literally every context. This is where my new project starts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Georginify - Firefox Extension to learn Georgian</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Due to the war in Ukraine I recently moved to Georgia and the first big issue I faced was Georgian alphabet. They don&amp;rsquo;t use Latin or Cyrillic characters so I needed to learn it to be able to read and study Georgian language. To say the truth I always liked their characters - they are really nice, look for your self: ყოველთვის მომწონდა ქართული ანბანი :) But for an unprepared person, they are almost indistinguishable from each other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
