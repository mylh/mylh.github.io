      <description>&lt;p&gt;I can say that I&amp;rsquo;m a serial maker and entrepreneur by spirit. From my early days on the Internet I try to create various online projects and convert them into stable businesses. When I do work for someone else (freelance, contractor jobs) I can&amp;rsquo;t say that every time I do the most interesting things out there, and this is where my ventures help me to keep going: I can learn whatever technology I want, I can do whatever I want in a way I want :) So it benefits a lot. Here is an incomplete (I hope) list of my projects. If a project generated revenue I put a $ sign corresponding to each digit in the total revenue for the project. ✝ - means project is discontinued.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
