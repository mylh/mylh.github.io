      <description>I can say that I&amp;rsquo;m a serial maker. From my early days on the Internet I try to create various online projects. When I do work for someone else I can&amp;rsquo;t say that every time I do the most interesting things out there, and this is where my side projects help me to keep going: I can learn whatever technology I want, I can do whatever I want in a way I want :) So it benefits a lot.</description>

      <description>Hi fellow indiehackers. I created a template project to quickly hop into a new project journey if you build with python, django and react and want to share it with you. https://github.com/mylh/indiehacker-boilerplate It&amp;rsquo;s opensource and under MIT license. I hope it will save some time for you.
I created many projects over the years and every time I had to repeat same boring steps before can actually start implementing a new idea.</description>

      <description>For over a year I have been siletnly playing with neural networks. Artificial Intelligence is definitely the future of humanity if it survives and neural networks is the most promising piece of technology leading us there. My main area of interests besides general AI lies in joining music and AI and so I was playing with it but there are no any great results yet to share. And recently there was a really revolutionary thing happened - a group of researchers released Stable Diffusion - a neural network capable of generating images given a textual prompt.</description>

      <title>Georginify - Firefox Extension to learn Georgian</title>

      <description>Due to the war in Ukraine I recently moved to Georgia and the first big issue I faced was Georgian alphabet. They don&amp;rsquo;t use Latin or Cyrillic characters so I needed to learn it to be able to read and study Georgian language. To say the truth I always liked their characters - they are really nice, look for your self: ყოველთვის მომწონდა ქართული ანბანი :) But for an unprepared person, they are almost indistinguishable from each other.</description>

      <title>Why I Stopped Using Facebook</title>

      <description>I was an ordinary Facebook user, not very social one - had a handful of &amp;ldquo;friends&amp;rdquo;, almost never posted or liked anything, mostly consumed news feed of people and groups I was subscribed to. I had an Instagram account where shared private photos with my friends. And I used WhatsApp as my primary messenger to communicate with everyone - family, friends, colleagues and other people I know.
All was good for many years.</description>

      <description>Hi, I am Dmitry - a father of three, programmer and music lover.
My Profession I write computer programs since 1990s and enjoy this activity so much that it became my main work for a lifetime. Worked with many languages - C/C++, Java, PHP, Haskell and others but fall in love with Python for its power to implement my ideas in fastest way possible. My second favorite language is Go, when I need to do a task that requires super high performance this is the language of my choice.</description>

      <description>How many tests we need to run to be sure that there are no errors introduced because of changes we made? This is the question we are going to answer using probabilistic simulations. Real life example from my work. We did it for TXN backtesting.
What Is TXN Backtesting TXN stands for Transaction check - which is a monitoring tool that executes several action steps in headless Chrome instance on our check servers.</description>
