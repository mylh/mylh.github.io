<h2 id="my-hobbies">My Hobbies</h2>
<p>I <em>really</em> love music. Listen mostly to classical music but mordern house or electronic music is my background sound when I run. I studied in musical school when I was a kid. Learned to play violin. Always wanted to play piano though and for last several years I make my dream come true. I play piano like almost every day, mostly Bach - preludes, inventions. Want to learn Well Tempered Clavier, Goldberg Variations, French and English suites.</p>
<p>I also love to run. Did different sort of sport activities in the past. Never thought I would run. But I tried several years ago and have been running regularly since then. To this date my total running distance is more than 2500km.</p>
