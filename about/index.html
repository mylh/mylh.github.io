<p>Hi, I am Dmitry - a father of three, programmer, entrepreneur and music lover.</p>
<h2 id="my-profession">My Profession</h2>
<p>I write computer programs since 1990s and enjoy this activity so much that it became my main work for a lifetime. Worked with many languages - C/C++, Java, PHP, Haskell and others but fall in love with Python for its power to implement my ideas in fastest way possible. My second favorite language is Go, when I need to do a task that requires super high performance this is the language of my choice.</p>
<p>As a solopreneur I run various <a href="/posts/my-projects/">projects and businesses</a> and do freelance work. My tech stack includes but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python and GoLang web development</li>
<li>Machine Learning / Neural Networks (Pytorch, fastai)</li>
<li>Django Framework, SciPy (Numpy, Pandas, etc), Celery</li>
<li>Cloud Deployment AWS/GCE</li>
<li>PostgreSQL, ClickHouse troubleshooting and fine tuning</li>

<h2 id="my-hobbies">My Hobbies</h2>
<p>I <em>really</em> love music. Listen mostly to classical music but modern house or electronic music is my background sound when I run. I studied in musical school when I was a kid. Learned to play violin. Always wanted to play piano though and for last several years I make my dream come true. I play piano like almost every day, mostly Bach - preludes, inventions. Want to learn Well Tempered Clavier, Goldberg Variations, French and English suites.</p>
<p>I also love to run. Did different sort of sport activities in the past. Never thought I would run. But I tried several years ago and have been running regularly since then. My total running distance is more than 5000km on November 2024.</p>
